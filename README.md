## 11 Ways to Measure Clean Growth 
When measuring progress on climate change, governments, analysts, and advocates too often benchmark success according to a single metric: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet to succeed in the long term with such a major adjustment to our economy and society, climate policies must position Canada to succeed in economic and social terms as well. 

  •	A new report from the Canadian Institute for Climate Choices uses data to show that climate, economic growth, and social objectives are connected in ways that will make it difficult to achieve sustained progress on one without addressing the others.

  •	The 11 “clean growth” indicators connect climate change to a series of economic and social objectives, including GDP growth, technology development, trade, jobs, affordability, and health.

  •	Where possible, the indicators compare progress across provinces and territories. Overall, there are signs of gradual progress. But it has been slow and uneven, and there are several areas where government policy could help accelerate clean growth.

Here, you can find the data used to create the indicators found in this report.
